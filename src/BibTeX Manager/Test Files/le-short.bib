	abstract		= {A mathematical model has been developed for the drilling action of a tricone bit which gives quantitative predictions for torque, given the bit geometry and the force/penetration relationships for the individual indentors. The results of the model are substantiated by a number of laboratory experiments conducted on a fully instrumented bit. Using this device the details of the indentor motion can be analysed and the forces acting on certain of the indentors can be obtained while drilling. The detailed mathematical model can be simplified to a field interpretation model in which the torque response is described in terms of a contribution from the gouging action of the bit teeth and a contribution associated with the indenting action of the teeth.},

	abstract		= {The parallel track scraping principle of conventional PDC bits largely limits the cutting efficiency and working life in deep formations. Cross-cutting polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit may be an efficient drilling tool that increases the rock-breaking efficiency through both cross-cutting and alternate-cutting modes of the PDC cutter. The motion track equation of the cross-cutting PDC bit was derived by using the compound coordinate system, and the motion track was analyzed. Meanwhile, through the unit experiment and discrete element simulation, the cutting force, volume-specific load, and crack propagation were analyzed under different cutting modes. Through establishing a nonlinear dynamic model of the bit-rock system, the speed-up mechanism of the novel bit was analyzed based on rock damage, rock stress state, and motion characteristic of the bit during the rock-breaking process. Compared with unidirectional cutting, cross-cutting produces less cutting force, more brittle fracture, and a greater decrease of formation strength. The novel PDC bit can put more rock elements into a tensile stress condition than a conventional PDC bit, and the plastic energy dissipation ratio of the cross-cutting PDC bit is lower while the damage energy consumption ratio is higher than they are for conventional bits, which is beneficial to increasing the ratio of fracture failure and improving rock-breaking efficiency. Laboratory drilling tests show that the cross-cutting PDC bit can create mesh-like bottom-hole features. Drilling contrast experiments show that a mesh-like bottom-hole pattern can be obtained by using the cross-cutting PDC bit, of which the ROP is obviously higher than that of the conventional bit when drilling in sandstone or limestone formation. Meanwhile, the influence of deviation angle, weight on bit, and rock properties on cutting efficiency of the cross-cutting PDC bit are studied.},

During whirl, the instantaneous center of rotation moves around the face of the bit, and the bit whirls backward around the hole.Cutters on a whirling bit can move sideways, backward, and much faster than those on a true rotating bit.The impact loads associated with this motion cause PDC cutters to chip, which, in turn, accelerates wear. Laboratory and field results show the detrimental effects of whirl on PDC bit rate of penetration (ROP) and life.}",

Many factors influence drilling dynamics such as pipe stiffness, mud properties, tortuosity, friction, bit design, & BHA geometry. A simple analytic model representing axial drilling dynamics is described and compared to a finite element drilling model and to drilling data. The analytic model shows that axial drilling dynamics may be represented by a first-order transfer function with a time constant dependent on axial stiffness and drillabillity.}",

	abstract		= {On the Norwegian Continental Shelf there are many fields and wells in late life production. There are also many nearby drilling targets with limited volumes to add. This situation requires new mindset in order to optimize tie-ins of new reserves to existing infrastructure. Retrofit multilateral well solutions are regarded as one enabeler in this context since they enable tie-in to existing producers from nearby targets through deep sidetrack operations.  There are many pre-requisites that must be in place for such solutions to be suitable. In addition, the risk of partial success involves loss of an existing producer.  A few such wells have been constructed by the operator in the last couple of years. The requirements and challenges are discussed. The implementations show that it is technically feasible to use conventional multilateral technology in ways that enable installation in producing wells. Improvements to existing solutions are sought in order to facilitate future implementations and to improve robustness of this technology.}
